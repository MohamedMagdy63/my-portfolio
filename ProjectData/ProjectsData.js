    desc :"For my graduation project in Computer Engineering at Modern Academy for Engineering, my team and I developed a substantial system named 'Auction World' This comprehensive system consist of two types of pages one for users and another for admins, which features a substantial Oracle database, represents the culmination of the passion we share for web development and machine learning. Our team consisted of five dedicated students, all of whom were enthusiastic about web development and machine learning. The project's core was centered around creating a user-friendly experience. To achieve this, we utilized React.js for crafting the web pages, while CSS was employed to style each page. This was my primary area of contribution to the project. To ensure optimal performance and responsiveness, we built a fast-response backend using Node.js. My involvement in this aspect of the project was significant and impactful. The Auction World system is designed to facilitate three distinct types of selling approaches: 1. Regular Selling: A conventional approach to selling products. 2. Live Auctions: Real-time auctions that require low latency to provide a smooth user experience.3. Scheduled Auctions: Auctions that are planned and scheduled in advance. The backbone of this system is the Oracle database, a robust choice that supports our goal of managing extensive amounts of data effectively and securely.",
